Run this script using python video_deidentification.py <source_video.mov> <destination_video.mov>.

Current Limitations : 
1. Currently this only supports mov, can be easily extended to mp4 as well.
2. Audio is not spliced in yet.
3. Frame processing is currently linear and there exist ways to speed this up.
